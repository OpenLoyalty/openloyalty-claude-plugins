## Problem Statement

{What triggered this work - the symptom or requirement that started this investigation}

## Hypothesis / Approach

{Initial assumption about the cause or planned approach to implement the feature}

## Investigation Steps

1. {Step 1 - what was done first}
2. {Step 2 - what was tried next}
3. {Step 3 - and so on...}

## Findings

| Finding | Details |
